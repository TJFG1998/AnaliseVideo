# AnaliseVideo
This program calculates value of money present in a video

Technologies used:
Opencv: libary for image processing in c/c++ and other lenguages
C: Compiling Language

This work aims to develop a program in C language, or C ++, that allows the automatic quantification of money in videos. In this sense, the program should read a given file indicated by the user (in * .mp4 format), identify all the currencies visible along the video, and present the respective sum. Furthermore, the following set of information should be made available during and / or after processing the video (on it): • Total number of coins observed throughout the video; • Number of coins per type (1, 2, 5, 10, 20 or 50 cent., And 1 or 2 euros); • Area and perimeter (in pixels) of all currencies observed throughout the video; • Drawing on the video image of the location (bounding area) and center of gravity of each coin, as well as an indication of its respective type.
 
Also keep in mind that: • The videos all have a resolution of 1280x720; • Videos have a frame rate of 30 fps
